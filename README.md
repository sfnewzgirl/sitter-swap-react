# SitterSwap

SitterSwap connects families with babysitters through referrals from friends. Families create a profile that lists & links to sitters who also have accounts. Families can check out each otherâ€™s list of sitters when they need help with child care.

### Why do you have two SitterSwap repos?
SitterSwap was originally created with Ruby on Rails as my final project during my wed development immersive in November 2016. In the fall of 2019, I decided to rewrite this project in React as a personal project.
